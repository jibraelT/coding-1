# what is a function?

# A function is a set of instructions taht will perform a specific task


# there are two variations of functions: userdefined functions
# and built in functions.

# Built in function: instructions that have already been written and are
# built in to the programming language 

print('Jibraels coding class') # print is a built-in function . we can identify functions
# by the rouynd brackets.

number = input(' please type in a number?') # another example of a built-in function

print(number)

# all data types, variables, and operators are just pieces for us
# to use in order to write instruction for function

# User Defined Functions - custom function created by an egineer
